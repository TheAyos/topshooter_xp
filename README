============
Experiments with tatermand's art from OpenGameArt. Each experiment is on its
own folder.

Experiments
===========
- rotating_swirls: From the effects assets, take the blue swirl graphic and
rotate a bunch of them according to circular motions of all kinds.

- radial_shot: From the effects assets, take the blue plazma arrow blue and
move a bunch of them radially outwards. The final result looks like a "nova"
spell from diablo 2.

This fellow has published for anyone to use a very, extremely, masterfully,
..., well crafted assets package. It has tons of graphics all assuming some
sort of top-down shooter. It has graphics for two kinds of shooters: space
ships shooters and humanoid with guns shooters.
