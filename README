============
Experiments with tatermand's art from OpenGameArt. Each experiment is on its
own folder.

Experiments
===========
- rotating_swirls: From the effects assets, take the blue swirl graphic and
rotate a bunch of them according to circular motions of all kinds.

- radial_shot: From the effects assets, take the blue plazma arrow blue and
move a bunch of them radially outwards. The final result looks like a "nova"
spell.

- plazma_arrow_shot_snapshots: Takes the blue plazma arrow graphics to draw
snapshots of its path as it'd move along when fired. This isn't an animation.
It merely draws the trajectory of the shot.

- plazma_arrow_shot_snapshots: Animate plazma arrow shots with the blue plazma
arrow shot graphics. They're shot and "hit" at random. Check the youtube
video below.

- sparts003: A simple particles system (my first attempt; the other two are
separete projects elsewhere). It's supposed to simulate simple impact
explosions (like when a lazer shot hits a wall).

This fellow has published for anyone to use a very, extremely, masterfully,
..., well crafted assets package. It has tons of graphics all assuming some
sort of top-down shooter. It has graphics for two kinds of shooters: space
ships shooters and humanoid with guns shooters.
